Howdy

So. You're interested in data science, but you don't know where to start. I want to let you know; you've come to right place.

Today, we'll dive into a process known as "data wrangling"... That word makes me think of cowboys for some reason. But seriously, finding good data and getting it into a pandas data-frame can actually be half the battle. I'll make sure you guys know how to find and load a dataset of your choice and do some quick analysis.

I'm thrilled to jump into the world of data wrangling with you. Let's get started.
