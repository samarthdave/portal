Interested in learning what Natural Language Processing is all about?

This hour long course will teach you how to identify and separate words, extract topics, and conduct sentiment analysis. We will be using [Python](https://python.org) for this course, relying heavily on [the NLTK package](https://www.nltk.org/).
